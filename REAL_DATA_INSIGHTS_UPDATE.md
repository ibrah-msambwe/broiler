- **Benefit**: All analytics in one place!

---

### **2. Real Data Integration** ✅

#### **What Changed:**
The AI system now uses **ONLY REAL DATA** from your actual batches and reports:

**BEFORE** ❌:
- Simulated examples
- Generic recommendations
- Static insights

**NOW** ✅:
- Real mortality rates from actual batches
- Real FCR from batch data
- Real health status monitoring
- Real report analysis (last 24 hours)
- Real batch ages for harvest planning
- Real critical report tracking

---

### **3. Automatic Report-Based Insights** 🤖

#### **NEW Feature: Instant Insights After Reports**

When a farmer submits a report, the system **AUTOMATICALLY**:

1. ✅ **Analyzes the report within 60 seconds**
2. ✅ **Checks mortality count** (alerts if >20 deaths/day)
3. ✅ **Reviews health reports** (high priority = instant insight)
4. ✅ **Generates specific recommendations**
5. ✅ **Shows in Analytics tab immediately**

**Example:**
```
Farmer submits health report at 10:00 AM
→ System detects "High" priority
→ Within 1 minute, AI generates:

⚠️ Health Issue Reported - Pemba Batch
Priority: High | Category: Health Report

Description: High priority health report submitted: 
"Birds showing respiratory symptoms"

Recommendation:
1) Review the health report immediately
2) Follow up with the farmer
3) Check symptoms observed
4) Number of birds affected
5) Treatment administered
6) Need for veterinary assistance

Affected Batches: [Pemba]
[Take Action] [Mark as Read]
```

### **4. Real-Time Monitoring** ⏱️

**Updates Every 60 Seconds:**
- Scans all batches
- Checks new reports
- Recalculates metrics
- Generates fresh insights
- Prioritizes by urgency

---

### **5. Data Validation** 🔍

**System now validates all data:**
- Skips batches with 0 birds
- Ignores invalid dates
- Checks for actual FCR values
- Validates report timestamps
- Ensures data quality

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Only uses batches with real data
if (totalChicks === 0) return  // Skip empty batches
if (fcr === 0) return         // Skip if no FCR data
if (!b.startDate) return false // Skip invalid dates
```
